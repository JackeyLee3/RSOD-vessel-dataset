# RSOD-vessel-dataset

The RSOD vessel dataset is a tiny vessel detection dataset on SAR images.

The RSOD vessel dataset was built based on the LS-SSDD-v1.0 dataset and Sentinel-1 images. It contained 20 large-scale SAR images, nearly 1179 small-scale SAR images, and a total of 2648 vessel objects. In the RSOD dataset, with each image having a size of 640 × 640 pixels, objects smaller than 32 × 32 pixels are classified as small objects, accounting for 84.62% of the total, as indicated by the rectangular box in the figure. The SAR images downloaded from Sentinel-1 were cropped into smaller images of 640 × 640 pixels.
